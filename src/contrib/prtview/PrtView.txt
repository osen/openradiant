Put prtview.dll in the Q3Radiant plugins directory.

This program is pretty self explanitary, but point needs to
be mentioned.  In the configuration menu for 3D view options,
the lines and polygons flags are tri-state.  In the third state,
the lines or polygons will only be drawn if the have the
hint flag set.  Older version of q3map will not set this flag
and the hint shader may have to be modified to set it.  As of
this writing, I do not know all the details.
