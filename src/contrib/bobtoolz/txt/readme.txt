What's a boy to do?
[=================]

Put The plugin in your GTKRadiant plugins folder:
e.g. mine: c:\gamez\quake3\GTKRadiant\plugins

Run Radiant, and select the toolz from the dropdown plugin menu.

Help is available in the form of a manual on my site.



For the new q3map bug highlighting feature, run autocaulk-build mini prt, then run autocaulk.
identify an area which has been caulked incorrectly, then reopen the map, select the q3map bug highlight option, and wait.
once the selected brushes appear, u have 2 choices, 

a) press i and remove all the original brushes, or 
b) keep going with both sets (slower, but more useful)

navigate to the problem region, you should find that the set of inverse brushes that has been built is missing a brush
at the problem area, i suppose the next problem is finding out why :]

this function is mainly provided for other coders to show the problem, and is probably of little use to anyone else,
but u never know.


Coming Soon:
[==========]
Region area saving. perhaps, if i get the time to finish it.
