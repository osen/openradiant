[=====================]

djbob

Added:
(16.05.01)
	Impemented a little feature that highligths the q3map bug that is causing problems for autocaulk, (see readme)
(01.04.01)
	Added DPatch class to implement patches, however radiant does not (currently) support adding patches to an entity via a plugin, so, its actually redundant atm, i was adding this to fix the patches being removed from entities probelm with dealing with entities outside of the worldspawn.
	
Changes:
(02.04.01)
	EPair keys and values can now be 128 characters long, not 64, happy now hydra?
	Texture reseter works on patches now too.

Removed:
(29.03.01)
	Removed CTF colour changer, it is now in the ctftoolz.

Fixed:
(02.04.01)
	Worldspawn brushes are rebuilt per brush, rather than per entity in texture reseter.
(03.04.01)
	Worldspawn brushes are rebuilt per brush, rather than per entity in brush cleanup.

Changes in v1100 (GTK):
[=====================]

djbob

Added:
(24.03.01)
	Added CTF colour changer for worldspawn+func_group.

Changes:
(25.03.01)
	Brought some functions over to using DMap class, allowing them to run on multiple entities, patches are still a no-no atm.
	This includes:
	
	a) brush cleanup, will now fix problems on brushes that are not in the worldspawn, and rebuild the entitiy afterwards.
	b) texture reseter will change textures on all brushes now, not just those in the worldspawn.
	c) CTF colour changer will also work on brushes outside of the worldspawn entity.

This introduces one prolem, patches in entities will no longer be part of the new entity, sorry for any trouble this causes, i will fix it soon hopefully.

Fixes:
(25.03.01)
	Fixed bug in DMap class that prevented it destroying brushes... thus enabling the class to work!!!!
