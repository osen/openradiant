===============
bitmap.cpp
Corrected a substitution error that would prevent code from reading a selected bitmap on the first pass, and possibly leave the bitmap file open.
Checks to ensure that main window has been created before updating the preview (which might be done if a bitmap filename was saved to ini file). Previous failure to do this resulted in Radiant console error messages.
===============
gendlgs.cpp
One tooltip was goofed up ("preview" instead of "main_preview"), resulting in "invalid cast from (NULL) pointer to GtkObject" in Radiant console.
Tooltips - oops. Use wave_radios[] rather than string constants.
Moved check for game type from SetDlgValues to GenSurfInit in gensurf.cpp. Since the game type presumably won't change while GenSurf is active this only needs to be checked once (and if it IS possible to change the game while GenSurf is active then quite a bit more needs to be changed).
Worked around strange bug in SetDlgValues. In release dll (not debug), the 2nd pass through the set_sensitive loop for game_radios crashed. Since the state of those radio buttons won't ever change during a single session, the state is only set once now. Sure would like to know what's going on there, though.
===============
view.cpp
Elevation and azimuth labels are right-justified.

TODO:
Check out Fix Points on Voodoo2 again. Previous attempt caused entire preview to be redrawn when moving mouse (GL_SCISSOR_TEST failed?)

===============
gendlgs.cpp
In ReadDlgValues, reads wavelength, amplitude, and roughness text boxes (previously ignored).
In create_main_dialog, set a "focus_out_event" for the above and added a "value_changed" for RandomSeed.
In main_go, added call to WriteIni
===============
gensurf.cpp
Set gszIni to "plugins/gensurf.ini" to get past assert error
ported WriteIni
===============
view.cpp
In DrawPreview, changed 2 occurrences of GL_LINE_LOOP to GL_LINE_STRIP for patches
