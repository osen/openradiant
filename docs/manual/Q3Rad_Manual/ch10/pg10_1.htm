<h1><a name = "tools7">Tools 7: Miscellaneous Commands</a></h1>

<h2><a name = "feedback">Feedback &amp; Read-outs</a></h2>

The bottom border of the map window holds four clusters of
feedback information.

<p><div class = "subheading">Z-Axis Layers</div>

<div class = "menu">(Shortcut: SHIFT + Middle mouse click on 2D map window)</div>

If you are using any window layout that includes the Z-axis
scale, you can see the vertical relationships between components
with this function.

<p><div class = "subheading">Cursor Coordinates</div>

These three coordinates, found to the left of center, report the
xyz position of the cursor in the 2D map window.

<ul><div class = "menu">x:: 0.0 y:: 0.0 z:: 0.0</div></ul>

<p><div class = "subheading">Brush &amp; Entity Counter</div>

This readout is located at roughly center position. It reports
the number of brushes (including brushes forming brush entities)
and the number of non-brush entities (items, spawn spots, lights,
etc.)

<ul><div class = "menu">Brushes: 0 Entities: 0</div></ul>

<p><strong>Pushing the Limits</strong>

This is a good place (as any) to talk about limits. <i>
Quake III Arena</i> has an upper limit of 2048 entities (including
entity lights!!) and while it's not an upper limit, staying under
8000 brushes is a pretty good idea.

<p><div class = "subheading">Selection</div>

This readout temporarily replaces the Brush &amp; Entity counter
when a map component is selected. The numbers represent the
dimensions of the selection.

<ul><div class = "menu">Selection X:: 0.0 Y:: 0.0 Z:: 0.0</div></ul>

<p><div class = "subheading">Origin</div>

This readout temporarily replaces the Brush &amp; Entity counter
when a select map component is moved. The numbers represent the
origin point of the selection (and track it as it moves).

<ul><div class = "menu">Origin X:: 0.0 Y:: 0.0 Z:: 0.0</div></ul>

<p><div class = "subheading">Cursor Travel Distance</div>

These three coordinates, found to the right of the brush and
entity counter, report the distance that cursor has traveled from
the point where the user has clicked on the 2D map window.

<ul><div class = "menu">Distance X:: 0.0 Y:: 0.0 Z:: 0.0</div></ul>

<p><div class = "subheading">Control Settings</div>

In the lower right corner of the editor window, you will see a
string of letters and numbers that might look something like
this:

<ul><div class = "menu">G:8 T:16 R:45 C:10 L:MR</div></ul>

Each of these letter/number combinations represents the setting
for one of the commonly used tools.

<p><table>

<p><div class = "subheading"><u>U</u>p Floor</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; <u>U</u>p Floor)

<br>(Shortcut: PAGE UP)</div>

This is a shortcut for moving up between "floors" in map. It
changes the user's Z height in the camera and map views. The view
moves to a point where it appears that the user is "standing" on a
"floor" (a brush with "air" space directly above it) directly above
the user's current position in the map.

<p><div class = "subheading"><u>D</u>own Floor</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; <u>D</u>own Floor)

<br>(Shortcut: PAGE DOWN)</div>

This is a shortcut for moving down between "floors" in map. It
changes the user's Z height in the camera and map views. The view
changes to a point where it appears the user is "standing" on a

(side and front).

<p><div class = "subheading">Layout</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Layout)</div>

<ul><strong>

XY (Top)</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Layout &gt; XY (Top))

<br> (ALT + X when pop-up is held open, cycles with XZ, ENTER
to select)</div>

This returns the main map view to XY Top view.

<p><strong>

YZ</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Layout &gt; YZ)

<br>(ALT + Y when pop-up is held open)</div>

Changes main (XY) map view to YZ Side view

<p><strong>

XZ</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Layout &gt; XZ)

<br>(ALT+ X when pop-up is held open, cycles with XY, ENTER to
select)</div>

Changes main (XY) map view to XZ Side view</ul>

<p><div class = "subheading">Zoom</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Zoom)</div>

If the <b><i>XY Top</i></b> window is changed to display either
<b><i>XZ front</i></b> or <b><i>YZ side</i></b> the XY commands
below function the same way relative to the window, zooming in and
out as commanded.

<ul><strong>

<u>X</u>Y 100%</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Zoom &gt; <u>X</u>Y 100%)

</div>

Changes zoom on main map view to full size.

<p><strong>

XY Zoom <u>I</u>n</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Zoom &gt; XY Zoom <u>I</u>n)

<br>(Shortcut: DELETE)</div>

Zooms closer to main map. Working in smaller grid scale becomes
easier.

<p><strong>

XY Zoom <u>O</u>ut</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Zoom &gt; Zoom <u>O</u>ut)

<br>(Shortcut: INSERT)</div>

Zooms out away from the main map. Working in larger grid scale
becomes easier.

<p><strong><u>Z</u> 100%</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Zoom &gt; <u>Z</u> 100%)</div>

Changes zoom on the z (height) scale to full size.

<p><strong>Z Zoo<u>m</u> In</strong>

<br>(Shortcut: CTRL + DELETE)</div>

Zooms in closer on the z (height) scale.

<p><strong>

Z Zoom O<u>u</u>t</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Zoom &gt; Z Zoom O<u>u</u>t)

<br>(Shortcut: CTRL + INSERT)</div>

Zooms out and away from the z (height) scale.

<p><strong><a name = "cubiczoom">Cubic Clip Zoom In</a></strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Zoom &gt; Cubic Clip Zoom In)

<br>(Shortcut: CTRL + ] )</div>

This requires that the Cubic Clipping function be toggled on. It
decreases the Depth of Field (distance in which map components are
seen) in the Camera window. Less map components are seen at one
time. Decreasing the distance seen in the Camera window can
significantly improve editor performance when viewing large numbers
of map components. See <a href = "#cubic">Cubic Clipping</a>.

<p><strong>Cubic Clip Zoom Out</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Zoom &gt; Cubic Clip Zoom Out)

<br>(Shortcut: CTRL + [ )</div>

This requires that the Cubic Clipping function be toggled on. It
Increases the Depth of Field (distance in which map components are
seen) in the Camera Window. Increasing the distance seen in the
Camera window can significantly slow down speed at which your point
of view moves in the camera window. Increase the zoom to maximum
distance only if you have a relatively powerful editing system. See
<a href = "#cubic">Cubic Clipping</a>.</ul>

<p><div class = "subheading">Show</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Show)</div>

This is a pop-up menu with checked toggle functions for each of
the features on the list. If a feature is checked, all map
components of that type will show in both the Camera window and the
Map windows. If the feature is not checked, all map components of
that type will be hidden.

<ul><strong><u>N</u>ames</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Show &gt; <u>N</u>ames)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

Shows names of entities.

<p><strong>Blocks</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Show &gt; Blocks)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

Shows an additional grid over the Map window with subdivisions
every 1024 units.

<p><strong>Co<u>o</u>rdinates</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Show &gt; Co<u>o</u>rdinates)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

Shows the Map window coordinates along the left and top edges of
the Map window.

<p><strong><u>E</u>ntities</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Show &gt; <u>E</u>ntities)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

Shows entities, including brush entities, lights, and
models.

<p><strong><u>P</u>aths</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Show &gt; <u>P</u>aths)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

Shows the linkage connections between entities. This includes
triggers targeted at entities and path lines.

<p><strong><u>L</u>ights</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Show &gt; <u>L</u>ights)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

Shows Light entities.

<p><strong><u>W</u>ater</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Show &gt; Water)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

Currently non-functional. Look for future fix. Shows brushes
with water, lava, or slime content.



<p><strong>Clip <u>B</u>rush</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Show &gt; <u>C</u>lip Brush)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

This shows brushes with the common/clip content, including
common/clip and common/weapon_clip. The entire brush is
affected, not just clip brush texture sides.

<p><strong><u>H</u>int Brush</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Show &gt; <u>H</u>int Brush)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

Shows brushes made with the hint texture.

<p><strong>Wor<u>l</u>d</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Show &gt; Wor<u>l</u>d)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

Shows all non-entity brushes.

<p><strong>Detail</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Show &gt; Detail)

<br>(Shortcut: CTRL + D)</div>

Shows all brushes marked with a Detail setting.

<p><strong>Curves</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Show &gt; Curves)

<br>(Shortcut: CTRL + P)</div>

Shows all curve patches.

<p><strong>Caulk</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Show &gt; Caulk)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

Shows brush sides containing the common/caulk texture (does not
affect entire brush).

<p><div class = "tip"><b>Design Tip:</b> When you optimize detail brushes by caulking
unseen brush faces, isolate the detail brushes in a region then
turn off Caulk. Brush faces that need caulking will show up clearly
as you move around the brushes.</div>

<p><strong>Angles</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Show &gt; Angles)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

Shows facing angle of player start spots by way of a white
arrow.</ul>

<p><div class = "subheading">Hide/Show</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Hide/Show)</div>

This is an immensely powerful and useful tool. It lets the user
temporarily hide map components that may be in the way of working
on other brushes. Hidden components are not affected by CSG
actions.

<ul><strong>

Hide Selected</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Shortcut: H)</div>
Selected map components are hidden from view (and CSG cutting
operations) until the Show Hidden command is executed.

<p><strong>Show Hidden</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Hide/Show &gt; Hide Selected)

<br>(Shortcut: SHIFT + H)</div>

Previously hidden map components are returned to view.</ul>

<p><div class = "subheading"><u>E</u>ntities as&hellip;</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; <u>E</u>ntities as&hellip;)

<br>(Toolbar: Show Entities as, rightmost button on toolbar)</div>

The editor can show model entities (referring at this point only
to Misc_Model entities) in several formats. <b>Note:</b> More
detail in a model shown in the Camera and map views will affect the
ability of the editor to display the map. If the editor responds
sluggishly, try reducing the level and/or type of detail shown for
models.

<ul><strong>Bounding Box</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; <u>E</u>ntities as&hellip; &gt; Bounding
Box)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>
This is the simplest form of display. A box defines the outer
dimensions of the model. This is the least costly manner of
display.

<p><strong>Wireframe</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; <u>E</u>ntities as&hellip; &gt; Bounding
Box)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

Non-functioning.

<p><strong>Selected Wireframe</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; <u>E</u>ntities as&hellip; &gt; Selected
Wireframe)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

The Model is displayed as a bounding box until selected, at
which point the wireframe mesh for the model appears.



<p><strong>Selected Skinned</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; <u>E</u>ntities as&hellip; &gt; Selected
Skinned)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>
The Model is displayed as a bounding box until selected, at
which point the skinned mesh for the model appears.

<p><strong>Skinned </strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; <u>E</u>ntities
as&hellip; &gt; Skinned)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>
Only the skinned mesh for the model appears in the map and
Camera views.

<p><strong>Skinned and boxed</strong>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; <u>E</u>ntities as&hellip; &gt; Skinned and
boxed)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>
The skinned mesh for the model appears inside a wire frame of
the bounding box in both the map and Camera views.</ul>

<p><div class = "subheading"><a name = "cubic">Cubic Clipping</a></div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View &gt; Cubic Clipping)

<br>(Shortcut: CTRL + \ )

<br>(Toolbar: Cubic Clipping button, to right of XYZ &amp; Texture
view mode buttons)</div>

<img src = "../Q3Rad_Manual_files/image040.png" width = 32 height = 30 hspace = 10 vspace = 2 align = "left">This command toggles on (checked) or off when selected. Cubic
Clipping may be the most effective way to improve editor
performance. When turned on, only those map components near
the player are displayed in the Camera window. Any map components
beyond a certain depth of field will not be displayed in the camera
window (it has no effect on map windows). As the user moves
through the map in camera view, map components will pop into being
as the point-of-view (POV) draws closer and disappear as the POV
moves farther away. The shorter the distance "seen" in the
camera view, the better will be the editor performance when moving
through the map. Use the <a href = "#cubiczoom">Cubic Clip Zoom</a> commands
(see above) to modify the depth of field seen in the camera
view.

<p><div class = "subheading">Open GL Lighting</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: View)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

This feature is not fully implemented yet. It toggles on
(checked) or off when selected. When it is finished, all planes
facing a particular direction will shade the same way (curves will
shade like brushes) and the overall quality of the camera view will
be better. It will be slower however.

<ul><b>

Tip:</b> As it currently is implemented, this lighting can be
useful when working with irregular surfaces all covered with the
same texture.</ul>

<p><div class = "subheading">Show Brush/Patch Dimensions</div>

<div class = "menu">(Shortcut to turn on: Q)

<br>(Shortcut to turn off: SHIFT + Q or CTRL + Q)</div>

When you select a brush, the hi-lighted image in the map window
shows its dimensions, in game units. If multiple patches or brushes
are selected, the size will be the dimensions of the grouping. If
any kind of non-brush model entity is included in the grouping, the
dimensions are not shown.

<h2><a name = "fileman">File Management Commands</a></h2>

<div class = "subheading"><u>N</u>ew Map</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: File &gt; <u>N</u>ew Map)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

This creates a new map file. If the current map file contains
any unsaved changes, the editor will offer the option to
cancel.

<p><div class = "subheading"><u>O</u>pen&hellip;</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: File &gt; <u>O</u>pen&hellip;)

<br>(Shortcut: CTRL + O)

<br>(Toolbar: opening folder icon)</div>

This opens up the Maps folder as defined in the preferences. It
will show all valid map files in that directory. User may browse to
other directories from here. Double clicking on a map file
icon or hi-lighting that map and selecting <u>O</u>pen will open
the map. The user may also type in a map file name. Be sure to add
the ".map" or ".reg" extensions or the editor will not find the
file.

<p><div class = "subheading"><u>S</u>ave&hellip;</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: File &gt; <u>S</u>ave&hellip;)

<br>(Shortcut: CTRL + S)

<br>(Toolbar: disk icon)</div>

Saves a new map file to the default Maps directory. A reopened
map file will be saved to its source directory. Note, that it is
usually a good idea to save the map into the directory used by the
compiler as the source of its map data. Remember to give the file a
name. The compiler doesn't like to work with files called Unnamed
Map.

<p><div class = "subheading">S<u>a</u>ve As&hellip;</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: File &gt; S<u>a</u>ve As&hellip;)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

Opens the default directory for maps and prompts the user to
give the map a filename.

<p><div class = "subheading">Save S<u>e</u>lected&hellip;</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: File &gt; Save S<u>e</u>lected&hellip;)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

The selected brushes are saved as a map file. This is not the
way to make prefabs, though.

<p><div class = "subheading">Save Re<u>g</u>ion</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: File &gt; Save Re<u>g</u>ion)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

If the user has "regioned off" a subset of the map, this command
will save it as a separate file. It is grayed out unless the user
has created a regioned area. The editor prompts the user to enter a
file name before saving.



<p><div class = "subheading">Reopening Maps</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: File)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

(ALT+1 to 6 when File menu is held open)

<br>OK, There isn't actually a command called this. When you open
the File Menu, you will see (after you've done some work on maps),
the path/file names for the last six maps that you worked on. They
are listed here for easy opening access).

<h2><a name = "projpref">Projects and Preferences</a></h2>

<p><div class = "subheading">New p<u>r</u>oject&hellip;</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: File &gt; New p<u>r</u>oject&hellip;)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

Make a new project file. This allows you to set up different
preferences.

<p><div class = "subheading">Load <u>p</u>roject&hellip;</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: File &gt; Load <u>p</u>roject&hellip;)

<div class = "subheading">Map info&hellip;</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: Edit &gt; Map info&hellip;)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

This gives a readout of brushes (including curve patches) and
entities in the map, including the total number of brushes that are
not part of entities. There is also a breakdown, by type, showing
the number of entities in the map.



<p><div class = "subheading">Entity info&hellip;</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: Edit &gt; Entity info&hellip;)

<br>(Shortcut: none)</div>

This gives a read-out of the entities in a map by their
type. It allows you to select an entity, which
hi-lights it in the XY Map. Good for locating lost entities.

<p><div class = "subheading">Preferences</div>

<div class = "menu">(Menu: Edit &gt; Preferences)

<br>(Shortcut: P)</div>

This opens the window for setting or modifying the parameters,
paths and features of the editor. Preferences are discussed in the
Installation &amp; Set Up section earlier in this document.

<h2><a name = "openmen">Opening Menus from the Keyboard</a></h2>

These are the keyboard shortcuts that open up the menus. If you
