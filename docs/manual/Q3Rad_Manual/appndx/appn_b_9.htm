<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>wait:</b> time in seconds before item respawns after being
picked up (default 5, -1 = never respawn).

<br><b>random:</b> random time variance in seconds added or
subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see Notes).

<br><b>count:</b> sets the amount of ammo given to the player when
weapon is picked up.

<br><b>team:</b> set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn
randomly after team master is picked up (see Notes).

<br><b>target:</b> picking up the item will trigger the entity this
points to.

<br><b>targetname:</b> a target_give entity can point to this for
respawn freebies.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Check Boxes/Spawnflags</strong>

<br>SUSPENDED : item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't
drop to the floor. Bots will only be attracted to suspended
entities if they are reachable by way of a jump pad or launch pad
(trigger_push).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn
is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up
previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key
set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the
teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.



<p>When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a
minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random
value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay =
wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).





<h2><a name = "world">Worldspawn Entity</a></h2>

<div class = "subheading">Worldspawn</div>

Only used for the world. You access the worldspawn entity by
selecting any non-entity brush in your map.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>message:</b> text to print at user logon. Used for name of
level.

<br><b>music:</b> path/name of looping .wav file used for level's
music (eg. music/sonic5.wav). This is for a piece of music
with only one part. To make a song play with both an intro and a
looping portion, the following is the correct form for the music
value:



<ul>music/intro.wav music/loop.wav</ul>



<p><b>ambient:</b> Adds a constant value to overall lighting. Use
not recommended. Ambient light will have a tendency to flatten out
variations in light and shade.

<br><b>_color:</b> This is the normalized formula for RGB
values for ambient light. A value is considered normalized
when it fits in a range between 0 and 1. If you are using a
tool like the Windows color picker, divide the value for each
component of the RGB values by 255. The result will be a
normalized value.

<br><b>gravity:</b> gravity of level (default is normal gravity:
800).
