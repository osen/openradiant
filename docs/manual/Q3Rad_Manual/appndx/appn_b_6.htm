<div class = "subheading">misc_model</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> red

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-16 -16 -16) (16 16 16)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Generic, one-size-fits-all placeholder for
inserting .md3 models in game. Requires compilation of map geometry
to be added to level.

<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>angle:</b> direction in which model will be oriented.

<br><b>model :</b> path/name of model to use (eg:
models/mapobjects/teleporter/teleporter.md3).*/



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>This is a premade mesh model, created in a program like
Kinetix's 3d Studio Max. It is a static (non-animating)
model.&nbsp; Shaders can give it the appearance of motion, but no
animation.&nbsp; The models should be stored in a directory with
the pathname: models/mapobjects. The process by which models are
made is not a part of this document. Currently, models only have
rotation on the Z axis.

<p>Models do not "clip" against players or weapon
hits. They are entirely non-solid. If clipping is important, The
user will need to build clip brushes that are roughly the size and
shape of the models.

<p>Do not use the flip or rotate tools on models. Only use the
entity facing buttons or manually change the angle value. The
purple "3d crosshair" is the origin point of the model.

<p><b>Make it:</b> Right mouse press on a map window to bring up
the floating entity selector.&nbsp; Select misc_model. A selection
dialogue box will open giving access to available .md3 files.&nbsp;
Select the one you want and it will load into the map.&nbsp; Now,
hit "n" to open the entity window. Click on the "model" key in the
key list box. Now edit the value field to remove part of the
line.

<p><b>Example:</b> <span class = "type">"c://program files/quake III
arena/baseq3/models/mapobjects/storch.md3"</span>

<p><div class = "subheading">misc_portal_camera</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> light orange

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Portal camera. This camera is used to
project its view onto a portal surface in the level through the
intermediary of a misc_portal_surface entity. Use the "angles" key
or target a target_position or info_notnull entity to set the
camera's pointing direction.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>angles:</b> this sets the pitch and yaw aiming angles of the
portal camera (default 0 0). Use "roll" key to set roll angle.

<br><b>target:</b> point this to a target_position entity to set the
camera's pointing direction.

<br><b>targetname:</b> a misc_portal_surface portal surface
indicator must point to this.

<br><b>roll:</b> roll angle of camera. A value of 0 is upside down
and 180 is the same as the player's view.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Check Boxes/Spawnflags</strong>

<br>SLOWROTATE : makes the portal camera rotate slowly along the
axis of camera to target or (selected direction).

<br>FASTROTATE : makes the portal camera rotate faster along the
axis of camera to target or (selected direction)..



<p><strong>Notes</strong>
<ul><li>Both the setting "angles" key or "targeting a target_position"
methods can be used to aim the camera. However, the target_position
method is simpler. In both cases, the "roll" key must be used to
set the roll angle. Generally, this is adjusted after compiling the
map at least once.

<li>If either the SLOWROTATE or FASTROTATE spawnflag is set, then
the "roll" value is irrelevant.</ul>



<p><div class = "subheading">misc_portal_surface</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> light orange

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Portal surface indicator. This will "lock
on" the brush face closest to it and identify as a portal. The view
displayed on the portal surface is the view of the
misc_portal_camera that this entity targets. Also used for mirrors
(see Notes).



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>target:</b> point this to a misc_portal_camera that "sees"
the view you want to display on the portal.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<ul><li>The entity must be no farther than 64 units away from the portal
surface to lock onto it.

<li>To make a mirror, apply the common/mirror shader to the surface,
place this entity near it but don't target a
misc_portal_camera.

<li>When used as a mirror, the mirror surface will display what the
entity can "see."</ul>



<p><div class = "subheading">misc_teleporter_dest</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> red

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-32 -32 -24) (32 32 -16)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Teleport destination location point for
trigger_teleporter entities. A "target_position" can also be used
for this.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>angle:</b> direction in which player will look when
teleported.

<br><b>targetname:</b> make the trigger_teleporter point to
this.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>In most cases, this is replaced by the "target_position"
entity.

<h2><a name = "path">Path_* Entities</a></h2>

<p><div class = "subheading">path_corner</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> brown

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Path corner entity that define the routes
that func_trains can be made to follow.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>target:</b> point to next path_corner in the path.

<br><b>targetname:</b> the train following the path or the previous
path_corner in the path points to this.

<br><b>speed:</b> speed of func_train (in game units per second)
while moving to the next path corner. This will override the speed
value of the train.

<br><b>wait:</b> number of seconds func_train will pause on path
corner before moving to next path corner (default 0 - see
Notes).

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<ul><li>Setting the wait key to -1 will not make the train stop on the
path corner, it will simply default to 0.

<li>The center of the origin brush in the func_train follows the
path.</ul>



<h2><a name = "shooter">Shooter_* Entities</a></h2>

<div class = "subheading">shooter_grenade</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> red-violet

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> This will shoot a grenade each time it's
triggered. Aiming is done by setting the "angles" key or by
targeting an info_notnull or target_position entity.



<p><div class = "subheading">shooter_plasma</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> red-violet

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> This will shoot a plasma ball each time
it's triggered. Aiming is done by setting the "angles" key or by
targeting an info_notnull or target_position entity.



<p><div class = "subheading">shooter_rocket</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> red-violet

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> This will shoot a rocket each time it's
triggered. Aiming is done by setting the "angles" key or by
targeting an info_notnull or target_position entity.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>angles:</b> this sets the pitch and yaw aiming angles of
shooter (default 0 0). The roll angle does not apply.

<br><b>targetname:</b> activating trigger points to this.

<br><b>target:</b> this points to a target_position entity for
aiming the grenades.

<br><b>random:</b> random aiming variance in degrees from the
straight line to the targeted entity (default 0 - see Notes).

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br>notteam: when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and
"CTF" modes.

<br>notsingle: when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player
mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<ul><li>When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a
maximum angle deviation from the normal trajectory formed by a
straight line between the shooter and the aiming entity it targets.
The final trajectory will be a random value anywhere between no
deviation at all (0) to maximum deviation (value of the random
key).

<li>Both the setting "angles" key or "targeting a target_position"
methods can be used to aim the shooter. However, the
target_position method is simpler.*/</ul>
