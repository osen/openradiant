<p><div class = "subheading">holdable_medkit</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> blue (.7 0 1)

<br><b>Dimensions:</b>&nbsp; (-16 -16 -16) (16 16 16)

<br><b>Game Function:</b>&nbsp; This is a Medkit that can be picked
up and used (once) later. Brings the player's health back to 100
when used. Player can only carry one holdable item at a time.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>wait:</b> time in seconds before item respawns after being
picked up (default 60, -1 = never respawn).

<br><b>random:</b> random time variance in seconds added or
subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see Notes).

<br><b>team:</b> set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn
randomly after team master is picked up (see Notes).

<br><b>target:</b> picking up the item will trigger the entity this
points to.

<br><b>targetname:</b> a target_give entity can point to this for
respawn freebies.

<br><b>notbot:</b> when set to 1, a bot will never seek out this
item

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Check Boxes/Spawnflags</strong>

<br>SUSPENDED: <b></b>item will spawn where it was placed in map and
won't drop to the floor.&nbsp; Bots will only be attracted to
suspended entities if they are reachable by way of a jump pad or
launch pad (trigger_push).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn
is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up
previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key
set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the
teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.



<p>When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a
minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random
value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay =
wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).*/
