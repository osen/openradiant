<h1>Appendix B: Entity Descriptions</h1>
<h2><a name = "item">Item_* Entities</a></h2>

Most of the properties for item entities are the same and are
listed immediately below. Properties that are unique to specific
entities follow those entries.



<p><strong>Shared Keys (for all item entities)</strong>

<br>All the entities in this grouping can have the following
keys.

<p><b>team:</b> set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn
randomly after team master is picked up (see Notes).

<br><b>target:</b> picking up the item will trigger the entity this
points to.

<br><b>targetname:</b> a target_give entity can point to this for
respawn freebies.

<br><b>notbot:</b> when set to 1, a bot will never seek out this
item.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p>Two other keys, wait and count, do not apply to all entities and
are described as they apply to individual entity types.



<p><strong>Check Boxes/Spawnflags</strong>

<br>SUSPENDED: item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't
drop to the floor. Bots will only be attracted to suspended
entities if they are reachable by way of a jump pad or launch pad
(trigger_push).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br><b>Team:</b> Just as you would set doors to work together with
the "team" key, you can do the same for item, weapon and ammo
entities. Give each entity in the team the same key value (example:
"team" "powerups"). The game randomly selects which team member
respawns next. You can set your own wait times. You can skew the
weighting towards a particular item by including multiple copies of
it. Example: 1 quad and 2 hastes in a team mean a greater chance
that a haste entity will appear next.

<p>The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn
is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up
previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key
set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the
teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.



<p>When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a
minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random
value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay =
wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).



<p><div class = "subheading">item_armor_body</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> blue

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-16 -16 -16) (16 16 16)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Red Armor - 100 points of protection. All
armor can be cumulated up to a maximum of 200 points and slowly
decays back to 100 points.



<p><strong>Custom Keys</strong>

picked up (default 25, -1 = never respawn).



<p><div class = "subheading">item_armor_combat</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> blue

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-16 -16 -16) (16 16 16)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Yellow Armor - 50 points of protectiong.
All armor can be cumulated up to a maximum of 200 points and slowly
decays back to 100 points.



<p><strong>Custom Keys</strong>

<br><b>wait:</b> time in seconds before item respawns after being

<p><div class = "subheading">item_armor_shard</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> blue

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-16 -16 -16) (16 16 16)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Green Armor Shard - 5 points of
protection. All armor can be cumulated up to a maximum of 200
points and slowly decays back to 100 points.



<p><strong>Custom Keys</strong>

<br><b>wait:</b> time in seconds before item respawns after being
picked up (default 25, -1 = never respawn).



<p><div class = "subheading">Item_botroam</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> orange

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-16 -16 -16) (16 16 16)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> An invisible entity that attracts a bot to
it. Used to move bots to parts of a map that might otherwise not be
used.



<p><strong>Custom Keys</strong>

<br><b>Weight:</b> non-zero floating point value, most often in the
range 0 to 400. Very low values are unlikely to attract a bot to
that area, since most bots have "desires" that attract them to
other game entities. (Higher values are allowed but keep in mind
that the bot should also be attracted to normal items. Don't
make the weight value too high.



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>The item_botroam entity can be used when a bot does not roam the
whole level or prefers to go to only specific areas. But don't
confuse these items with "way points". They are more like magnets.
This (invisible) item can be placed in a map just like regular
items. Nobody can actually pick up the item it's only used to
attract bots to certain places of the map. The value is the weight
of the roam_item is relative to the weight assigned other items in
the map (each bot has its own weights). The bot character specific
item weights are stored with the bot characters in the
botfiles/bots/ sub-folder in the .pk3 file.

<p>When a bot should never go for a specific item the key "notbot"
with value "1" can be used for that item. This key with value can
be used for every available item in Quake III Arena.

<p><div class = "tip"><b>Design Tip:</b> Wait to place these items until you've done a
significant amount of live play testing on the final map against
bots. Observe a bot-only match. See which parts of the map they
DON'T use frequently. Use bot_roam entities to encourage the
bots to follow more paths through the map. Example: In one of id's
CTF maps, it was eventually observed that bots were most likely to
use only one entrance when assaulting the base. Placement of
item_botroam entities along the other entrance paths might have
solved this.</div>

<h2><a name = "light">Light Entity</a></h2>

<p><div class = "subheading">light</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> bright green&nbsp; (see Notes)

<br><b>Dimensions</b>: (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Non-displayed light entity. The default
condition emits white light in all directions at a value of 300.
The apparent brightness of the light is modeled on "real world"
physics, so the falloff in brightness willl be an inverse square of
distance from the source. It can be colored. It can be targeted on
an info_null entity to make a spotlight.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>light:</b> value of light intensity (default 300).

<br><b>_color:</b> weighted RGB value of light color (default white
- 1 1 1).

<br><b>target:</b> point this to an target_position, info_null or
info_notnull to create a spotlight effect.

<br><b>radius:</b> sets radius of light cone for spotlights (default
64) in game units. Radius measurement is made at the targeted
entity. Light must target an info_null entity (info_nulls are only
used by the compiler and need not be "remembered" by the game
engine during play).



<p><strong>Check Boxes/Spawnflags</strong>

<br>LINEAR: light falloff will be linear instead of inverse square
of distance from source.



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<ul><li>Linear fall off will not make much difference on low value
lights. Useful on high value lights where the light travels long
distances.

<li>If the "Light drawing" preference is selected (under
Preferences), the editor shows the light entities as diamond shaped
pieces the color of the light they cast. If not, they are light
yellow green cubes.</ul>


<p><strong>Coloring Lights</strong>

<br>To quickly change the color of a light entity, use on of the
following methods.

<ol><li><b>CTRL + k:</b>&nbsp; With the entity
window open, select a light entity in either the map or camera
window. Press CTRL + k. This brings up the windows color selector.
Select a color and choose "OK".&nbsp; The editor automatically
normalizes the light colors.

<li><b>Sample Texture:</b> Select the light
entity. Select a texture in either the texture window or the camera
window.&nbsp; Hit SHIFT + middle mouse button.

<li><b>Manual Entry:</b> Type in the value
for the key _color as a 3 numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive).

<li><b>Copy Existing:</b> Select another
light entity whose color value the user would like to duplicate. In
the editor window, lef click on the key "_color". Now select the
light entity to be colored. Hit ENTER.</ol>
