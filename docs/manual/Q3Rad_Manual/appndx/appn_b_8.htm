<h1>Appendix B: Entity Descriptions</h1>
<h2><a name = "team">Team_* Entities</a></h2>

These entities only function when a team style game is being
played. Most are for Capture the Flag. They do not need to be
marked with notfree, since that is part of their nature.



<p><div class = "subheading">team_CTF_blueflag</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> blue

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-16 -16 -24) (16 16 32)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Blue team flag for CTF games.



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>This cannot be suspended (or the bots won't find it). It must be
reachable by players of both teams, since it is where a player must
return an opponent's flag.

CTF games. This is where players spawn when they join the Blue team
(at the start of a game or upon entering a game in progress).

<h2><a name = "trigger">Trigger_* Entities</a></h2>

<div class = "subheading">trigger_always</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> gray

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Automatic trigger. It will fire the
entities it targets as soon as it spawns in the game.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>target:</b> this points to the entity to activate.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>For reliable internet play, make any trigger which can be passed
through at least 32 game units deep.



<p><div class = "subheading">trigger_hurt</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> gray

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> size of brush used

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Any player that touches this will be hurt
by "dmg" points of damage once per server frame (very fast). A
sizzling sound is also played while the player is being hurt.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>dmg:</b> number of points of damage inflicted to player per
server frame (default 5 - integer values only).

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).

<p><strong>Check Boxes/Spawnflags</strong>

<br>START_OFF: if set, the trigger will initially start off in the
game.

<br>SILENT: supresses the sizzling sound while player is being
hurt.

<br>NO_PROTECTION: player will be hurt regardless of protection (see
Notes).

<br>SLOW: changes the damage rate to once per second.



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<ul><li>The invulnerability power-up (item_enviro) does not protect the
player from damage caused by this entity regardless of whether the
NO_PROTECTION spawnflag is set or not.

<li>A trigger_hurt always starts on in the game.

<li>For reliable Internet play, make any trigger which can be passed
through at least 32 game units deep.
</ul>


<p><div class = "subheading">trigger_multiple</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> gray

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> size of brush used

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Variable size repeatable trigger. It will
fire the entities it targets when touched by player. Can be made to
operate like a trigger_once entity by setting the "wait" key to -1.
It can also be activated by another trigger that targets it.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>target:</b> this points to the entity to activate.

<br><b>targetname:</b> activating trigger points to this.

<br><b>wait:</b> time in seconds until trigger becomes
re-triggerable after it's been touched (default 0.2, -1 = trigger
once).

<br><strong>random:</strong> random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from
"wait" delay (default 0 - see Notes).

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<ul><li>When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a
minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random
value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay =
wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

<li>For reliable Internet play, make any trigger which can be passed
through at least 32 game units deep.
</ul>


<p><div class = "subheading">trigger_push</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> gray

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> size of brush used

<br><b>Game Function:</b> This is used to create jump pads and
launch ramps. It MUST point to a target_position or info_notnull
entity to work. Unlike target_push, this is client side
predicted.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>target:</b> this points to the target_position to which the
player will jump.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<ul><li>To make a jump pad or launch ramp, place the
target_position/info_notnull entity at the highest point of the
jump and target it with this entity.

<li>This trigger automatically makes the bouncepad sound.

<li>Speed of travel is determined by the distance needed to reach
the target entity. Longer = faster.

<li>For reliable Internet play, make any trigger which can be passed
through at least 32 game units deep.
</ul>


<p><div class = "subheading">trigger_teleport</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> gray

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> size of brush used

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Touching this will teleport players to the
location of the targeted misc_teleporter_dest or target_position
entities. This entity allows client prediction of events. It is the
preferred method.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>target:</b> this must point to a misc_teleporter_dest entity
or a target_position entity.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<ul><li>For reliable Internet play, make any trigger which can be passed
through at least 32 game units deep.

<li>When you give multiple targets the same target name, the
teleporter will randomly select from one each time it is used.
