<div class = "subheading">target_delay</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> aqua

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> The target_delay trigger is an
intermediary time delay trigger. Like a target_relay (see below),
this can only be fired by other triggers which will, in turn, cause
it to fire its own targets



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>targetname:</b> activating trigger points to this.

<br><b>target:</b> this points to entities to activate when this
entity is triggered.

<br><b>wait:</b> delay in seconds from when this gets triggered to
when it fires its own targets (default approx. 1).

<br><b>random:</b> random time variance in seconds added or
subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see Notes).

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a
minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random
value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay =
wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).



<p><div class = "subheading">target_give</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> red

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> This is used to give ammo, weapons, health
or items to the player who activates it.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>target:</b> this points to the item(s) to give when
activated.

<br><b>targetname:</b> activating trigger or spawn entity points to
this.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<ul><li>There are 2 ways to use this entity.

<ol type = "a"><li>To automatically give items to players when they spawn
in the game: make a spawn location entity like
info_player_deathmatch or CTF respawn points target this entity,
then make it target the item(s) to give to the player upon
respawn.

<li>To give items to players during the game: make a
trigger_multiple target this entity, then make it target the
item(s) to give to the player when the trigger is touched. This is
how the column of health and armor in Q3DM10 works.</ol>

<li>Items targeted to be given are not seen in the map.</ul>



<p><div class = "subheading">target_kill</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> gray

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> This will kill the player who activates
the trigger that fires this target.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>targetname:</b> the activating trigger points to this.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).*/



<p><div class = "subheading">target_laser</div>

<br><b>Map Entity Color:</b> red

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Generates a red laser beam. I think this
can somehow spawn in the game, I saw it once but it's too
inconsistent to be usable. Commented out.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>angles:</b> alternate "pitch, yaw, roll" angles method of
aiming laser (default 0 0 0).

<br><b>target:</b> point this to a target_position entity to set the
laser's aiming direction.

<br><b>targetname:</b> the activating trigger points to this.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Check Boxes/Spawnflags</strong>

<br>START_ON: when set, the laser will start on in the game.



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>Since none of the game maps in Quake III Arena used this
function, it is not likely to be a functioning entity.



<p><div class = "subheading">target_location</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> Dark Green

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Location marker used by bots and players
for team orders and team chat in the course of Teamplay games. The
closest target_location in sight is used for the location. If none
is in sight, the closest in distance is used.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>Message:</b> name of the location (text string).
Displayed in parentheses in front of all team chat and order
messages. Shorter is better.

<br><b>count:</b> color of the location text displayed in
parentheses during team chat. Set to 0-7 for color.

<ul>0 : white (default)

<br>1 : red

<br>2 : green

<br> 3 : yellow

<br> 4 : blue

<br> 5 : cyan

<br> 6 : magenta

<br> 7 : white</ul>

<b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><div class = "tip"><b>Design Tips:</b> The target locations are "line-of-sight." If
a player can "see" it, and that target is the closest to the
player, then that location message is displayed. Be
conservative in placing location markers. Because of the way the
location code is implemented, it causes a large amount of data to
be transmitted regularly. It has been explained that the game
serrver has to constantly keep track of, and update to the clients,
a data table equal to all the location markers multiplied by all
the players. Not only that, but it must calculate line of sight
from players to location markers and calculate the distance from
the location marker.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place the target locations in such a way that the entity can be
"seen" from most, if not all, the positions that a player can stand
in when it is inside that area. Fewer are better, even if it
means that occasionally, a team mate is in an unknown location.</div>

<p><div class = "subheading">target_position</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> Dark Green

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-4 -4 -4) (4 4 4)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> This is an aiming target for entities like
light, misc_portal_camera, and trigger_push (jump pads and launch
pads) in particular.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>Targetname:</b> the entity that requires an aiming direction
points to this.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>Use this as the target for any entity that must be actively
targeted during the game (do not use it as a target for
spotlights).

<br>See Tips, Tricks and Tutorials for the method used to make jump
pads.



<p><div class = "subheading">target_print</div>

<br><b>Map Entity Color:</b> dark green

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> This will print a message on the center of
the screen when triggered. By default, all the clients will see the
message.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>message:</b> text string to print on screen.

<br><b>targetname:</b> the activating trigger points to this.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Check Boxes/Spawnflags</strong>

<br>REDTEAM : only the red team players will see the message.

<br>BLUETEAM : only the blue team players will see the message.

<br>PRIVATE : only the player that activates the target will see the
message.



<p><div class = "subheading">target_push</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> gray

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)





<br><b>Game Function:</b> This is not recommended for creating jump
pads and launch ramps. The direction of push can be set by the
"angles" key or pointing to a target_position or info_notnull
entity. Unlike trigger_push, this is NOT client side predicted and
must be activated by a trigger.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>angles:</b> this sets the pitch and yaw aiming angles of push
entity (default 0 0). The roll angle does not apply.

<br><b>speed:</b> speed of push (default 1000 game units per
second). Has no effect if entity targets an aiming entity.

<br><b>targetname:</b> the activating trigger points to this. Push
originates from the location of the trigger.

<br><b>target:</b> this points to the aiming entity to which the
player will jump.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Check Boxes/Spawnflags</strong>

<br>BOUNCEPAD : if set, trigger will play bounce noise instead of
beep noise when activated (see notes).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<ul><li>The player will first move from the trigger to the target_push
and then on towards the target_position.

<li>To make a jump pad or launch ramp, create a trigger_multiple
where the jump must originate. Place the target_push directly above
the trigger_multiple and place the target_position entity at the
highest point of the jump. Target the trigger_multiple to the
target_push and target the target_push to the
target_position/info_notnull (or set the target_push's "angles"
key).

<li>Note that the "angle" key also
works.

<li>A target_push can be used to make a wind tunnel push effect (as
opposed to the jump pad effect of a trigger_push). It pushes the
activator in the direction of the angle value or towards its apex,
a targeted target_position entity.

<li>The default speed is 1000.

<li>If bouncepad is checked, it will play the bouncepad sound
instead of windfly.</ul>


<p><div class = "tip"><strong>Design Tip:</strong>

<br>There is a way to make the target push play proper sounds. Just
create a sound\movers\plats folder under baseq3 and put a sounds
windfly.wav in it. It can be the sound from the Q2 or your own
custom looping if you're up to it.</div>

<p><div class = "subheading">target_relay</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> aqua

<br><b>Map Entity Color:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> This can only be activated by other
triggers, which will, in turn, cause it to activate its own
targets.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>targetname:</b> activating trigger points to this.

<br><b>target:</b> this points to entities to activate when this
entity is triggered.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Check Boxes/Spawnflags</strong>

<br>RED_ONLY : only red team players can activate trigger.

<br>BLUE_ONLY : only red team players can activate trigger.

<br>RANDOM: one of the targeted entities will be triggered at
random.



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>Use this when you need to split off targeting functions along
separate paths.



<p><div class = "subheading">target_remove_powerups</div>

<br><b>Map Entity Color:</b> blue

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> This takes away all item_* type powerups
from player except health and armor (holdable_* items are not taken
away either). This must be activated by a button or
trigger_multiple entity. The player that activates the trigger will
lose any powerup(s) currently in his possession.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>targetname:</b> activating trigger points to this.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).*/



<p><div class = "subheading">target_score</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> bright green

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> This is used to automatically give frag
points to the player who activates this. A spawn location entity
like info_player_* or CTF respawn points can target this entity to
give points to the player when he spawns in the game. Or a trigger
can also be used to activate this. The activator of the trigger
will get the points.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>targetname:</b> activating entity points to this.

<br><b>count:</b> number of frag points to give to player (default
1).

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).*/



<p><div class = "subheading">target_speaker</div>

<br><b>Map Entity Color:</b> bright green

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Sound generating entity that plays .wav
files. Normal non-looping sounds play each time the target_speaker
is triggered. Looping sounds can be set to play by themselves (no
activating trigger) or be toggled on/off by a trigger.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>noise:</b> path/name of .wav file to play (eg.
sound/world/growl1.wav - see Notes).

<br><b>wait</b>: delay in seconds between each time the sound is
played ("random" key must be set - see Notes).

<br><b>Random:</b> random time variance in seconds added or
subtracted from "wait" delay ("wait" key must be set - see
Notes).

<br><b>targetname:</b> the activating button or trigger points to
this.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Check Boxes/Spawnflags</strong>

<br>LOOPED_ON: sound will loop and initially start on in level (will
toggle on/off when triggered).

<br>LOOPED_OFF: sound will loop and initially start off in level
(will toggle on/off when triggered).

<br>GLOBAL: sound will play full volume throughout the level.

<br>ACTIVATOR: sound will play only for the player that activated
the target.



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<ul><li>The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the
implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a
particular player model. For example, if you want to create a
"bottomless pit" in which the player screams and dies when he falls
into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit
and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the
"noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current
player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is
Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is
Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an
excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your
levels.

<li>The combination of the "wait" and "random" keys can be used to
play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but
both keys must be used together. The value of the "random" key is
used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time
delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and
maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait +
random).</ul>



<p><div class = "subheading">target_teleporter</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> red

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Activating this will teleport players to
the location of the targeted misc_teleporter_dest entity
(target_position can also be used). Unlike trigger_teleport, this
entity must be activated by a trigger and does NOT allow client
prediction of events.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>targetname:</b> activating trigger points to this.

<br><b>target:</b> this must point to a misc_teleporter_dest
entity.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>When you give multiple targets the same target name, the
teleporter will randomly select from one each time it is used.
