The Internet is an excellent source for information about Quake
engine editing.&nbsp; The sites listed here provide a variety of
useful editing resources.

trafficked web pages with a history of stability. But, because

<a href="http://ricebug.qeradiant.com/" target = _blank>
http://ricebug.qeradiant.com/</a>

<br>Some good tutorials on Q3Radiant (the Quake 3 editor) and QERadiant (the Quake 2
editor).

<p><div class = "subheading">RUST - Game Design.net</div>

<a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/" target = _blank>
http://www.gamedesign.net/</a>

<br>RUST has been a prime source for Quake engine editing for some
time.

<h2><a name = "edtools">Editing Tools</a></h2>

<p><div class = "subheading">GenSurf</div>

<a href="http://tarot.telefragged.com/gensurf/index.shtml" target = _blank>
http://tarot.telefragged.com/gensurf/index.shtml</a>

<br>GenSurf is a "natural" terrain creation tool that converts a
grayscale bitmap into a web of triangular brushes or curve patches.
Used with care, it can make some very interesting irregular
surfaces.

<p><div class = "subheading">Milkshape 3D</div>

<a href="http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft/home.html" target = _blank>
http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft/home.html</a>

<br>This is a shareware editor for 3D models. Support for <i>Quake
III Arena's native</i> md3 format is forthcoming.

<p><div class = "subheading">Quake 3 Arena Shader Editor</div>

<a href="http://www.larian.com/rat/q3ase.html" target = _blank>
http://www.larian.com/rat/q3ase.html</a>

<br>This is a tool for editing shaders. It allows you to construct
the shader in realtime, seeing what works you build it.

<h2><a name = "prefabs">Prefab Sources</a></h2>

<div class = "subheading">Gamedesign.net Prefabs</div>

<a href=
"http://prefabs.gamedesign.net/game.php3?game_id=13&amp;num=0" target = _blank>http://prefabs.gamedesign.net/game.php3?game_id=13&amp;num=0</a>

<br>This Rust's source for prefabricated map plug-ins. These here
are in the form of .map files instead of <i>Quake III Arena's</i>
native .pfb format.

<p><div class = "subheading">Quake Prefab Park 2</div>

<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/qpp/qpp2/" target = _blank>
http://www.planetquake.com/qpp/qpp2/</a>

<br>These are prefabs designed for use with <i>Quake</i> and <i>
Quake 2</i>, which means the ones with movement or action gimmicks
most likely will not work. And of course, you'll need to
retexture anything you find here if it's not a <i>Quake III
Arena</i> prefab.

textures, tutorials or links to tutorials on making your own.

<div class = "subheading">Developer's FAQ (Quake3mods)</div>

<a href="http://www.q3seek.com/edit.php3" target = _blank>
http://www.q3seek.com/edit.php3</a>

<br>This site answers a lot of questions about map making, model
making, texturing and skinning. Mod makers appear to have
submitted much of the information.

<p><div class = "subheading">Official Quake III Arena FAQ (Quake3world.com)</div>

<a href="http://www.quake3world.com/info/faq.html" target = _blank>
http://www.quake3arena.com/faq/</a>

Most of the information pertains to general problems players
encounter with Quake III Arena, and doesn't have a lot to do with
map making.

<p><div class = "subheading">RUST - Game Design.net</div>

<a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/quake3/faq/" target = _blank>
http://www.gamedesign.net/quake3/faq/</a>

<br>This development-oriented site has a Quake III Arena FAQ though at the moment it's not particularly helpful.

<div class = "subheading">LVL - Q3A Edition</div>

<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/lvl/" target = _blank>
http://www.planetquake.com/lvl/</a>

<br>A great level review site. It also has a great beta section for people to beta test your maps before you release and get you some feedback to make it one of the best levels out there.
