<h1>Appendix B: Entity Descriptions</h1>
This Section owes much of the background and testing research to three dedicated Quake Engine editing supporters, <i>Suicide20</i>, <i>inolen</i>, and <i>EuteTic</i>. It is based on version 1.1 (12/22/99) of a document that they created and gave us permission to include with the official id editor documents.

<p>"Keys" are keywords that represent the in-game properties of an
entity. Some are flags that determine whether an entity will
appear in a particular game play mode. Others define extents or
rates for entity movement. Others establish how much of some game
effect will occur (example: damage) or how long to wait until an
event occurs or can reoccur.



<p>With the exception of properties that can be set by checkboxes,
the map maker will need to type in keys (names for game function
properties) and their values (numbers or strings) into fields
within the entities window.



<p>Keys that are set by checkboxes in the editor are called
"Spawnflags" and will be shown in All Caps. The rest are shown in
lowercase, as they should be typed into the editor field.



<h2><a name = "basinfo">Basic Key information</a></h2>
<b>Angle:</b> This is the direction of facing or direction of
movement for an entity. Set this value with the Angle buttons on
the entity window. The angle value can be typed in as any positive
value between 1 and 360.



<p><b>Color:</b> This key only affects md3 models that are built
into func_entities. The color is the color of light used to
illuminate the model. It is expressed as a normalized three
digit RGB formula.



<p><b>Entity Dimensions:</b> The minimum and maximum coordinate
dimensions of the entity box.



<p><b>Light:</b> This key only affects md3 models that are built
into func_entities.



<p><b>Map Entity Color:</b> This is the color of the generic entity
box used to represent the entity in the map editor.



<h2><a name = "ammo">Ammo_* Entities</a></h2>
The properties for ammo entities are all very similar.

<p><b>Map Entity Color:</b> Blue
<br><b>Entity Dimensions:</b> (-16 -16 -16) (16 16 16)

<p>These are ammunition boxes for weapons in the game. They can be
represented by either a blue entity box, or the ammo box model
itself. With the exception of the type and amount of ammo given to
the player upon pick up, all ammo entities have the same
properties.

<p><strong>Custom Keys</strong>
<br><b>count:</b> sets the amount of ammo given to the player when

<p><strong>Common Keys</strong>
<br><b>wait:</b> time in seconds before the item respawns after
being picked up (default 40, -1 = never respawn).

<br><b>random:</b> random time variance in seconds added or
subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see Notes).

<br><b>team:</b> set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn
randomly after team master is picked up (see Notes).

<br><b>target:</b> picking up the item will trigger the entity this
points to.

<br><b>targetname:</b> a target_give entity can point to this for
respawn freebies.

<br><b>notbot:</b> when set to 1, a bot will never seek out this
item

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Check Boxes/Spawnflags</strong>
<br>SUSPENDED: item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't
drop to the floor. Set by Checkbox. Bots will only be attracted to
suspended entities if they are reachable by way of a jump pad or
launch pad (trigger_push).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn
is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up
previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key
set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the
teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.



<p>When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a
minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random
value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay =
wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).



<p><div class = "tip"><strong>Design Notes</strong>

<br>An ammo item can be given a negative "count" value. Taking away
ammo in combat would be a bad idea but in combination with a
target_give entity, it can be used to set up games mods like Rocket
Arena by removing the machinegun ammunition from a player when he
spawns into the map.</div>
