<h1>Appendix B: Entity Descriptions</h1>
<h2><a name = "func">Func_* Entities</a></h2>
Func_Entities include a wider variety of game purposes than
other entity classes. They are sometimes represented by simple
function boxes. But many are built out of brushes, patches and
models. These constructions are sometimes called "b_models", though
for many of them the word "mover" works as well, since they are
made to be moving objects in the game world.

<p><div class = "subheading">func_bobbing</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> N/A

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> size of map components used

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Solid entity that oscillates back and
forth in a linear motion. By default, it will have an amount of
displacement in either direction equal to the dimension of the
brush in the axis in which it's bobbing. Entity bobs on the Z axis
(up-down) by default. It can also emit sound if the "noise" key is
set. Will crush the player when blocked.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>speed:</b> amount of time in seconds for one complete
oscillation cycle (default 4).

<br><b>height:</b> sets the amount of travel of the oscillation
movement (default 32).

<br><b>phase:</b> sets the start offset of the oscillation cycle.
Values must be 0 &lt; phase &lt; 1. Any integer phase value is the
same as no offset (default 0).

<br><b>noise:</b> path/name of .wav file to play. Use looping sounds
only (eg. sound/world/drone6.wav - See Notes).

<br><b>model2:</b> path/name of model to include (eg:
models/mapobjects/jets/jets01.md3).

<br><b>origin:</b> alternate method of setting XYZ origin of sound
and .md3 model included with entity (See Notes).

<br><b>light:</b> constantLight radius of .md3 model included with
entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).

<br><b>color:</b> constantLight color of .md3 model included with
entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Check Boxes/Spawnflags</strong>
<br>X_AXIS : entity will bob along the X axis.
<br>Y_AXIS : entity will bob along the Y axis.



<p><strong>Notes</strong>
<br>In order for the sound to be emitted from the location of the
entity, it is recommended to include a brush with an origin shader
at its center, otherwise the sound will not follow the entity as it
moves. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to
using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point
of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either
the origin brush or the origin coordinate value. The movement of
the func_bobbing follows a sinoid wave pattern.



<p><div class = "subheading">func_button</div>
<b>Map Entity Color:</b> N/A

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> size of map components used

<br><b>Game Function:</b> When a button is touched by a player, it
moves in the direction set by the "angle" key, triggers all its
targets, stays pressed by an amount of time set by the "wait" key,
then returns to its original position where it can be operated
again.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>
<br><b>angle:</b> determines the direction in which the button will
move (up = -1, down = -2).

<br><b>target:</b> all entities with a matching targetname will be
triggered.

<br><b>speed:</b> speed of button's displacement (default 40). Speed
is in game units per second.

<br><b>wait:</b> number of seconds button stays pressed (default 1,
-1 = return immediately).

<br><b>lip:</b> lip remaining at end of move (default 4 units).

<br><b>health:</b> if set to a non-zero value, the button must be
damaged by "health" amount of points to operate.

<br><b>light:</b> constantLight radius of .md3 model included with
entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).

<br><b>color:</b> constantLight color of .md3 model included with
entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).

<br><b>model2:</b> path/name of model to include (eg:
models/mapobjects/pipe/pipe02.md3).

<br><b>origin:</b> alternate method of setting XYZ origin of .md3
model included with entity (See Notes).

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>
<br>Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an
origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the
model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the
origin brush or the origin coordinate value.



<p><div class = "subheading">func_door</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> N/A

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> size of map components used

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Normal sliding door entity. By default,
the door will activate when player walks close to it or when damage
is inflicted on it. Doors move a distance equal to their dimension
along the selected angle of&nbsp; travel, minus the "lip" key
value.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>angle:</b> determines the opening direction of door&nbsp; (up
= -1, down = -2).

<br><b>speed:</b> determines how fast the door moves (default 100).
Speed is in game units per second.

<br><b>wait:</b> number of seconds before door returns (default 2,
-1 = return immediately - see Notes).

<br><b>lip:</b> lip remaining at end of move (default 8).

<br><b>targetname:</b> if set, a func_button or trigger is required
to activate the door.

<br><b>health:</b> if set to a non-zero value, the door must be
damaged by "health" amount of points to activate (default 0).

<br><b>dmg:</b> damage to inflict on player when he blocks operation
of door (default 4). Door will reverse direction when blocked
unless CRUSHER spawnflag is set.

<br><b>team:</b> assign the same team name to multiple doors that
should operate together (see Notes).

<br>light: constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity.
Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).

<br><b>color:</b> constantLight color of .md3 model included with
entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes. (default 1 1 1).

<br><b>model2:</b> path/name of model to include (eg:
models/mapobjects/pipe/pipe02.md3).

<br><b>origin:</b> alternate method of setting XYZ origin of .md3
model included with entity (See Notes).

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Check Boxes/Spawnflags</strong>

<br><b>START_OPEN:</b> the door will spawn in the open state and
operate in reverse.

<br><b>CRUSHER:</b> door will not reverse direction when blocked and
will keep damaging player until he dies or gets out of the way.



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>Unlike in Quake 2, doors that touch are NOT automatically
teamed. If you want doors to operate together, you have to team
them manually by assigning the same team name to all of them.
Setting wait =-1 for normal touch doors makes them work
erratically. Use this only for damage-only ("health" key set to
non-zero value) or targeted doors. Setting the origin key is simply
an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2
key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin
point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate
value.



<p><div class = "subheading">func_group</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b>&nbsp; Light blue

<br><b>Dimensions</b>: Determined by dimensions of map
components.

<br><b>Game Function:</b> This is not an entity. It is strictly an
editor utility to group world brushes and patches together for
convenience (selecting, moving, copying, etc). You cannot group
entities with this.



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>The TAB key can be used to flip through the component pieces of
a selected func_group entity, isolating individual components.



<p><div class = "subheading">func_pendulum</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> Light blue

<br><b>Dimensions</b>: Determined by dimensions of map
components.

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Solid entity that describes a pendulum
back and forth rotation movement. Rotates on the X axis by default.
Pendulum frequency is a physical constant based on the length of
the beam and gravity. Contact with the pendulum instantly kills a
player.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>angle:</b> angle offset of axis of rotation from default X
axis (default 0/360).

<br><b>speed:</b> angle of swing arc in either direction from
initial vertical position (default 30).

<br><b>phase:</b> sets the start offset of the swinging cycle.
Values must be 0 &lt; phase &lt; 1. Any integer phase value is the
same as no offset (default 0).

<br><b>noise:</b> path/name of .wav file to play. Use looping sounds
only (eg. sound/world/drone6.wav).

<br><b>model2:</b> path/name of model to include (eg:
models/mapobjects/jets/jets01.md3).

<br><b>origin:</b> alternate method of setting XYZ origin of
entity's rotation axis and .md3 model included with entity (default
"0 0 0" - See Notes).

<br><b>light:</b> constantLight radius of .md3 model included with
entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).

<br><b>color:</b> constantLight color of .md3 model included with
entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. The
center of that brush will be the point through which the rotation
axis passes. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method
to using an origin brush. Pendulum will rotate along the X axis by
default. Pendulum cannot rotate along Z axis. The speed of swing
(frequency) is not adjustable, and the "dmg" key (although set in
the Q3A maps) has no effect whatsoever. When using the model2 key,
the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point
defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate
value.

<p><div class = "subheading">func_plat</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> Light blue

<br><b>Dimensions</b>: Determined by dimensions of map
components.

<br><b>Game Function:</b> This is a rising platform that a player
can ride to reach higher places. Plats must always be drawn in the
raised position, so they will operate and be lighted correctly but
they spawn in the lowered position. The plat will stay in the
raised position until the player steps off. There are no proper
sounds for this entity, only beep noises, so sound call paths must
be adjusted (see Notes).



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>speed:</b> determines how fast the plat moves (default 150)
in game units per second.

<br><b>lip:</b> lip remaining at end of move (default 16). Has no
effect if "height" is set.

<br><b>height:</b> if set, this will determine the total amount of
vertical travel of the plat (see Design Notes).

<br><b>dmg:</b> damage to inflict on a player when he blocks
operation of plat (default 4). Plat will reverse direction when
blocked.

<br><b>targetname:</b> if set, the trigger that points to this will
raise the plat each time it fires. The plat raises and comes back
down a second later if no player is on it.

<br><b>light:</b> constantLight radius of .md3 model included with
entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).

<br><b>color:</b> constantLight color of .md3 model included with
entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).

<br><b>model2:</b> path/name of model to include (eg:
models/mapobjects/pipe/pipe02.md3).

<br><b>origin:</b> alternate method of setting XYZ origin of .md3
model included with entity (See Notes).

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is
implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes
of which it's made minus the lip value. But if the "height" key is
used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be
exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and
regardless of the value of the "lip" key. Using the "height" key is
the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one
for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times
their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate
method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the
origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point
defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate
value.



<p><div class = "tip"><strong>Design Notes:</strong>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clip brushes can be used to create the
additional size for "thin" plats. Func_plats were pulled from all
maps in the final build of Quake 3 Arena due to some problems in
their operation, particularly as it related to bot function.&nbsp;
The id designers recommend using plats with care and that plats be
built as "solid" pillar-like lifts (more like those in Doom).

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a way to make plats play
proper sounds. Just create a sound\movers\plats folder under baseq3
and put 2 sounds named pt1_start.wav and pt1_end.wav in it. Those
can be the renamed sounds from the Q2 plats or renamed copies of
the sound\movers\doors sounds you can extract from your pak0.pk3
file or new custom sounds if you're up to it. Thanks to Fragzilla
for the tip.</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> Light blue

<br><b>Dimensions</b>: Determined by dimensions of map
components.

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Solid entity that rotates continuously.
Rotates on the Z axis by default and requires an origin brush. It
will always start on in the game and is not targetable.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>speed:</b> determines how fast entity rotates (default
100).

<br><b>noise:</b> path/name of .wav file to play. Use looping sounds
only (eg. sound/world/drone6.wav).

<br><b>model2:</b> path/name of model to include (eg:
models/mapobjects/bitch/fembotbig.md3).

entity's rotation axis and .md3 model included with entity (default
"0 0 0" - See Notes).

<br><b>light:</b> constantLight radius of .md3 model included with
entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).

<br><b>color:</b> constantLight color of .md3 model included with
entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Check Boxes/Spawnflags</strong>

<br><b>X_AXIS:</b> entity will rotate along the X axis.

<br>Y<b>_AXIS:</b> entity will rotate along the Y axis.



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. The
center of that brush will be the point through which the rotation
axis passes. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method
to using an origin brush. It will rotate along the Z axis by
default. You can check either the X_AXIS or Y_AXIS box to change
that



<p><div class = "subheading">func_static</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> N/A

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> Determined by components

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Static solid bspmodel. Can be used for
conditional walls and models for different game types.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>model2:</b> path/name of model to include (eg:
models/mapobjects/bitch/fembotbig.md3).

<br><b>light:</b> constantLight radius of .md3 model included with
entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).

<br><b>color:</b> constantLight color of .md3 model included with
entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will
correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush
or the origin coordinate value. Because the map has only a single
bot navigation file, Func_Statics cannot be used to make
significant changes in game play flow between differing game
types.



<br><div class = "subheading">func_timer</div>

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8
8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Time delay trigger that will continuously
fire its targets after a preset time delay. The time delay can also
be randomized. When triggered, the timer will toggle on/off.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>wait:</b> delay in seconds between each triggering of its
targets (default 1).

<br><b>random:</b> random time variance in seconds added or
subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see Notes).

Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Check Boxes/Spawnflags</strong>

<br><b>START_ON:</b> timer will start on in the game and
continuously fire its targets.



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a
minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random
value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay =
wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).

<br><b>color:</b> constantLight color of .md3 model included with
entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
