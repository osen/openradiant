<h2><a name = "info">Info_* Entities</a></h2>

<p><div class = "subheading">info_camp</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> Dark green (0 0.5 0)

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> This atttracts bots which have a camping
preference in their A.I. characteristics. It should be placed at
least 32 units away from any brush surface.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>
<br><b>range:</b> number of units that the bot can move away from
camp entity while camping on it.

<br><b>weight:</b> number that is compared against the weight
assigned to all the other camp spots in the map to determine if a
bot chooses to camp there. The value is normalized against all
other weight values.



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>Examples of Q3A bots which have a high camping preference are:
Razor, Tank Jr., Grunt, Patriot and Doom. Examples of Q3A bots
which have a low camping preference are: Klesk, Mynx, Sarge, Keel
and Xaero. Info_Camp entities should be reachable by "normal"
means, including relatively non-complex rocket jumps.

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> Dark green (0 0.5 0)

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Used as a positional target for entities
that can use directional pointing. A target_position can be used
instead of this but was kept in Q3A for legacy purposes.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>targetname:</b> must match the target key of entity that uses
this for pointing.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Used as a positional target for light
entities to create a spotlight effect. A target_position can be
used instead of this but was kept in Q3A for legacy purposes.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>targetname:</b> must match the target key of entity that uses
this for pointing.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free

<p><div class = "subheading">info_player_deathmatch</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> Pink (1 0 0)

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-16 -16 -24) (16 16 32)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Normal player spawning location for Q3A
levels.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>angle:</b> direction in which player will look when spawning
in the game. Does not apply to bots.

<br><b>target:</b> this can point at a target_give entity for
respawn freebies.

<br><b>nobots:</b> when set to 1, bots will never use this spawn
point to respawn in the game.

<br><b>nohumans:</b> when set to 1, human players will never use
this spawn point to respawn in the game.

<br><b>notfree:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free
for all" and "Tournament" modes.

<br><b>notteam:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in
"Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

<br><b>notsingle:</b> when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single
Player mode (bot play mode).



<p><strong>Check Boxes/Spawnflags</strong>

<br>INITIAL: makes the spawnpoint the initial place for the player
to spawn at the beginning of the game. This is also where the
player spawns as a spectator.



<p><div class = "tip"><b>Design Tip:</b> If you include an
info_player_deathmatch entity in a CTF map, players from both teams
can respawn at that location. Great for placing respawn spots in
contested central battleground areas.</div>

<p><div class = "subheading">info_player_intermission</div>

<b>Map Entity Color:</b> Pink (1 0 1)

<br><b>Dimensions:</b> (-16 -16 -16) (16 16 16)

<br><b>Game Function:</b> Camera for intermission screen between
matches. This also automatically generates the podium for bot arena
matches (see Notes). Can be aimed by setting the "angles" key or
targeting an pointing to an aiming entity. Use only one per
level.



<p><strong>Keys</strong>

<br><b>angles:</b> alternate "pitch, yaw, roll" angles method of
aiming intermission camera (default 0 0 0).

<br><b>target:</b> point this to an info_notnull or target_position
entity to set the camera's pointing angles.



<p><strong>Notes</strong>

<br>In Single Player bot arena matches, the podium for the 1st, 2nd
and 3rd place players at the end of the match is generated by this
entity. The podium's origin will automatically be located 128 units
in the direction of the camera's view and 84 units down from the y
height of the view line at that point. It will also always be
generated on a level plane regardless of the pointing angle of the
camera so if that angle is too steep, part of the podium model
might not be visible. If the origin point of the podium model is
inside brush geometry, the podium will not draw. Make sure you
leave at least 106 units of free space in front of where the camera
points to otherwise the podium model won't be visible at all.

in the game.

<br><b>target:</b> this can point at a target_give entity for
respawn freebies.
