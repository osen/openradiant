<h2><a name = "camera">Better movement in camera window</a></h2>

<p>
By enabling "Freelook in 3D window" in the preferences screen you can use a 
noclip style of movement in the camera window. Rightclick in your camera window 
(or shift+rightclick if you are in 2 mouse button mode) to start freelook mode. 
The mouse can be used to look around, up arrow is forward, down arrow is 
backwards, left and right are strafing. You can control the sensitivity of the 
camera controls in the preferences screen, directional velocity is for movement 
(forward/back/strafe) and angular velocity is mouse sensitivity. Also you can 
enable inversed mouse mode here.
</p>

<p>
Another way of moving backward and forward in the camera window is by using 
your mousewheel, scroll up is forward, scroll down is backwards. This works in 
all camera modes, classic as well as freelook.
