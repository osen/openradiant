<h1>Appendix A: usage of targetShaderName and targetShaderNewName</h1>

<p>
The targetShaderName and targetShaderNewName keys can be used with any entity 
that supports the target key (the entity instance does not actually have to use 
the target key for these new keys to work).  If both are defined, then when the 
entity decides to activate its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that 
were originally the same name as the targetShaderName value, will be changed to 
the targetShaderNewName value.
</p>

<p>
For example this would make it look like the red light shader is "turning on":
</p>

<p>
"targetShaderName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"<br>
"targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
</p>

<p>
And this would turn it back off:
</p>

<p>
"targetShaderName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"<br>
"targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
</p>

<p>
Note that the ORIGINAL shader name is used in both instances, not whatever it 
happens to be currently.  Also, of course, this will happen globally.  If the 
mapper wanted to affect only a certain set of red lights, he/she would need to 
make a unique shader name to be used with that set.
</p>

<p>
The code that supports these keys is in G_UseTargets in g_utils.c.
