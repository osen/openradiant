        <p><font size="3">The following is a list of things to look for, do, or
        be aware of when converting a pre-existing CTF map to Q3:TA game types.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="3"><font FACE="Symbol">· </font>New file name. Don’t
            overwrite your old CTF map.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3"><font FACE="Symbol">· </font>If you want to
            convert an existing Q3A CTF map to the team arena game types, it
            would be good to make a clean break from Q3A. Give it a new file
            name and even a new map name. We did the same for our original CTF
            maps.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3"><font FACE="Symbol">· </font>If you don’t
            already have one, build a central “neutral” area in keeping with
            the style of the rest of the map. This is an important play area,
            perhaps even more so than the bases. Make the opportunities for
            gameplay here just as exciting as the flag bases.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3"><font FACE="Symbol">· </font>Fix-up Time. This is
            your opportunity to fix all those things that players have been
            telling you are wrong with your map (sticky spots, bad hallway
            connections, misaligned textures, poor item placement). The id guys
            did it, so can you. It’s also a good time to read or re-read the
            Q3Radiant section on optimizing maps for bots (you may want to look
            for the recent updates that accompany the bspc tool). Pay particular
            attention to placement of clip brushes and cluster portals. If
            players can’t reach an area of the map (such as sky above ceiling
            grills, or beyond window bars, fill the unreachable space with clip
            brush - just walling it off is often worse than doing nothing.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3"><font FACE="Symbol">· </font>Add Team Power-ups
            in or near bases.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3"><font FACE="Symbol">· </font>Place .md3 powerup
            pad bases beneath Power-ups</font></p>
            <p><font size="3"><font FACE="Symbol">· </font>Remove “ow”
            marks from floors that were used as weapon locators. Replace them
            with the base floor for that texture. You may also be able to
            simplify the geometry.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3"><font FACE="Symbol">· </font>Place Weapon pad
            markers (use the pfbs) beneath weapon spawns.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3"><font FACE="Symbol">· </font>Consider adding new
            weapon types or replacing existing ones with the new weapons. Don’t
            just do it because they are new, though. Make sure the weapon is
            appropriate to the map. If you don’t like a weapon or it’s
            effect on play, don’t add it to your map.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3"><font FACE="Symbol">· </font>Replace old Q3A CTF
            banners with new Q3: TA banners. Use the banner prefabs (pfbs) for
            ease of placement.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3"><font FACE="Symbol">· </font>Consider adding team
            logos as decals (see FLOOR ARROWS above) to other parts of the map,
            like walls and floors.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3"><font FACE="Symbol">· </font>Make sure that the
            team logos on banners and floors; walls, etc. have the proper
            facing. You should be able to properly read the word “red” or
            “blue” on the placeholder logo.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3"><font FACE="Symbol">· </font>Add in the flag
            bases and obelisks. Follow directions noted above (page 9) to mark them for
            gameplay types.</font></p>
