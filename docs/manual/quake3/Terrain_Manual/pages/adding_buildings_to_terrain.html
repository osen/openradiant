<p>This is really best addressed as a number of semi-related building tips:</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plan Ahead.</b> If you know you want buildings
in your map, plan their locations from the first. Very complicated buildings
(lots of geometry and surface detail) should be isolated away from long views.
One reason for this is to control in view polygon counts. The second (and really
obscure one) is to reduce the amount of z-compression that will affect the
structures.</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build to Support Game play.</b> Each of the
structures in the Q3:TA terrain maps was built to support a game play need.
Quite often, less is better than more.</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build Simply.</b> Simple, uncomplicated
architecture may be best. The more complicated you make your buildings, the less
complicated the terrain around them can be. Depends on what you want to play up.
The busy look of many Q3A maps doesn’t translate well to large terrain.
Details are lost at great distances and only add to the triangle complexity of
maps containing them.</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detail Content.</b> With few exceptions ALL
the geometry inside the terrain map is detail content, not just the terrain
entity. The walls forming the corridor in mpterra2 may be the only non-detail
structures in that map. Making geometry into detail makes a map far easier and
faster to compile. If you want to block vis inside your structures, create
simple caulk structures … much the same way as described for vis blocking the
terrain.</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z-Compression Problems.</b> Review the the map
in 16 bit mode during development. This brings out z-fighting issues that occur
at long distances. This z-fighting is created by detail brushes being compressed
into each other (The Q3A engine does a significant amount of “z compression”
as geometry becomes farther away from the viewer). This z-compression is far
less apparent in 32 bit modes, but we have to remember that many people turn
down graphic features in order to simply play Q3A on their systems (not just to
get ridiculously high frame rates).</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fit Structures to the Terrain. </b>Don’t
just set structures on terrain and expect them to look right. Make your
buildings look like they belong where you put them. Accommodate the rise and
fall of terrain in your floor plans … or “dig” into the terrain brushes to
create basements, tunnels and whatever you need. You can also adjust the height
map to better arrange the geometry around structures, or manually tweak the
triangles once the structures are in place. History is full of examples of
really interesting buildings that have been built to accommodate difficult
terrain like hills, cliffs and mountains.</p>
