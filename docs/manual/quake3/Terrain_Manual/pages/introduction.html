reorganizing of thought, but in many ways is not substantially different from
making a halls-and-rooms type of map. The designer still has to be concerned
about how much can be seen at one time and give thought to map flow and play.
The rules and restrictions that guide conventional map design are still there
… it just occurs on a much grander scale. You still have to think about poly
counts, that hasn’t changed; but generally speaking, the polys that you will
use to make your game terrain are VERY large and less are likely to be seen all
at once during a game.</font></font></p>

The “<i>terrain</i>” style maps in Quake III: Team Arena do not represent any
changes to the Quake 3 Engine. The power to make them work has always been there,
unrealized and untapped. What has changed is the way map files are created and
processed. These construction techniques rely on changes in the <a href="http://www.qeradiant.com/" target="_blank"> Q3Radiant editor</a>
and the q3map program that processes the map files into game files.</font></p>
