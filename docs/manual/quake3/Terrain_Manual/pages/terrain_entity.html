<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process of building a piece of terrain focuses on a new thing called the
“<i>Terrain Entity</i>.” Technically speaking, the terrain in Team Arena is nothing
more than a func_group entity (brushes only) with a number of key/value pair
combinations that are unique to it. These key/value pairs define it as terrain (<i>terrain</i>), establish the piece of art that will be used to locate textures on it
the terrain (alphamap), define the group of shaders used to blend textures
across its surface (shader), and tell how many different unique shaders will be
used. The bsp-making utility, Q3Map compiles and textures the terrain entity
based on the parameters specified in those key/value pairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible to have multiple terrain entities in a map (see Terrain
Entities below). Once you learn the method and the techniques, terrain is
relatively easy to create. One warning though … easy to create does not mean
easy to compile. Large maps take a much longer time to compile, and huge maps
are likely to take what seems like forever. However, there are some
construction, lighting, and shader options that can significantly cut down on
compile time - as will be noted later.</p>
