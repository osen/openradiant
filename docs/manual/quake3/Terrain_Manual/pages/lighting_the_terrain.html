<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terrain maps also require some rethinking about the way you light maps.</p>
</font><b><i><font SIZE="4">
<p>Vertex Only</p>
</font></i></b><font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are making a large terrain map, you should plan on making your terrain
textures be lit by vertex lighting only. Lightmaps can quickly become far too
large for the game to handle.</p>
<p>Make sure your large terrain textures contain the following parameters:</p>
<b>
<p>Surfaceparm nolightmap</b> //signifies vertex lighting only.</p>
<b>
<p>Q3map_novertexshadows</b> //this is what keeps those caulk vis blockers from
causing ugly shadows to form on your terrain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are using q3map_sun in your sky …</p>
<b>
<p>Q3map_forcesunlight</b> //this makes the light emitted by a q3map_sun
parameter affect the vertex lit surface.</p>
</font><b><i><font SIZE="4">
<p>Light Sources</p>
</font></i></b><font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For outdoor maps, the obvious source of lighting ought to be the sky. The
skies in the mpterra maps began with skies used in more conventional Team Arena
maps, but were modified to better suit the needs of the terrain worlds.</p>

  <p>· </font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman">Slow Down Those Clouds.</font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman">
  One thing to consider is slowing down the rate of cloud movement. What looks
  OK in smaller maps looks wrong in vast panoramas.</p>
  </font><b><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
  <p>· </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" color="#FFFFFF">Strong Sunlight is
  Good.</font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" color="#FFFFFF"> For team maps,
  you want to try and keep the light relatively the same in both base areas, so
  if you have mountains or large base structures, having the light come in at a
  nearly vertical angle is good, but less dramatic.

  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">· </font> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman">Ambient Light is Not
  So Bad.</font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" color="#FFFFFF"> Since the
  beginning of Q3A map development we’ve said things like “Ambient Lighting
  is bad”. Well, the problems caused by ambient lighting are still there
  (flattening of shadows and colors), but with the distance of the play areas
  from the sky surface (in some maps), adding an ambient really helps bring up
  the overall light value in the map. Start low, maybe around an ambient value
  of 5 and creep upwards until the map looks right. It is VERY IMPORTANT that
  you give your ambient light a color. If you leave it white, you get ugly pink
  light instead of white. Even specifying white makes it look wrong. Best
  suggestion is to sample the sky texture color and translate that into an rgb
  formula for your ambient. One warning
  though … if you include “interior spaces” in your maps, the ambient
  light will affect those areas too. You will not get the deep dark shadows you
  may want in there.

  Backsplash</font></b></font><font FACE="Times New Roman"><font color="#FFFFFF">. The attributes of the sky
  shader can have a significan</font>t effect on the amount of time it takes to perform
  a light compile on a map. You have to think of the sky as a huge area light.
  However, unlike light emitting textures (like your average light fixture), the
  sky doesn’t need to be illuminated itself. Therefore, you can eliminate the
  backsplash light feature which is the default status of the q3map_surfacelight
  parameter. Your sky shader should have the parameter q3map_backsplash with a
  value of -1. Removing backsplash light doesn’t affect the appearance of the
  sky, but does remove a significant amount of compiling overhead when the
  -light algorithm is used (the normal way you light things).</p>

  <p>· </font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman">Sky Shader Trick#2: Big
  Subdivisions.</font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman"> Q3Map automatically
  subdivides the sky into triangle quads. The more triangle quads, the more
  light emitting surfaces you have on your sky (if q3map_surfacelight is used).
  The light compile calculates for every one of these light emitting surfaces.
  Increase the size of the subdivision and you get less light emitters and a
  faster compile.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
  <p>· </font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman">Sky Shader Trick #3: -V-light.</font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman">
  This is a fast lighting algorithm. It’s especially fast for calculating sky
  lighting. It loses a little precision, but it can greatly speed up the time it
  takes to light a map. Even if you decide to use a normal light operation for
  your final map, using -vlight for interim compiles can mean a lot less time
  spent waiting on the compiler to see your results.</p>

<p>The Light Grid</p>
</font></i></b><font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is discussed in detail under terrain-related Worldspawn features. One of
the things that can add enough memory complexity to a large terrain map, enough
to make it unplayable (read crash the game), is the light grid. Think of the
light grid as a map for determining how to light entities in the world. It’s
what makes player models appear to move in and out of shadows as they move
through the world. It’s a nice effect, but costly in memory terms. For the
largest maps in Q3:TA, we “traded down” to a less detailed light grid.
Increasing the size of grid subdivisions from 32 units to 256 units did this. We
experimented with smaller and larger grids and settled on 256 x 256 x 256 as the
best size. Smaller and the grid became large and unwieldy. Larger (especially on
the z dimension) and not enough light reached some of the entities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The details of this feature are noted below under Terrain-Related WorldSpawn
Features.</p>
